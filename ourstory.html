  <h1 class="st">Our Story</h1>
  <p>&nbsp;→&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Learning Space started in 2014 as a charitable organization by conviction. Our journey started as
training cum implementation partner for a 2-year Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics
(STEM) project for 20 Rainbow Homes in the twin cities of Hyderabad and Secunderabad which aimed
at improving learning abilities of ~1300 children taking shelter in these orphanages using technology
aided teaching and learning. Later we handled training and implementation of another STEM project
for about 12,000 less privileged students studying at 88 government primary, upper-primary and high
schools of Nampally and Khairatabad Mandals in Hyderabad. These projects were done in
collaboration with United Way Hyderabad, Bodhaguru and some IT companies. We also worked with
some other NGOs such as Association for Promoting Social Action (APSA) and Suma Niketan.
Learning Space Foundation is a registered as a public charitable trust in Dec, 2018.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;→&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we were working with those organizations and schools, we got to know about some unfortunate
incidents where children were being sexually abused, bullying and harassing other students, eve
teasing, some children endangering their future by making wrong decisions etc. One such example is
Chotu (name changed to protect privacy). He is an intelligent youth, but unaware of the child marriage
act and POCSO, married a minor girl against elders' wish and landed in jail. Most of them being first
generation learners, they have little knowledge about law and how their actions and decisions can
destroy their dignity and future. It feels devastated if we think about what happens to their self-concept.
Studies reveal that teenagers with low self-esteem have low confidence, feel insecure and may develop
anti-social attitude.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;→&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They need to be given awareness on health and hygiene as well. It is a common sight during breaks,
that kids eat packaged junk foods which are very harmful for growing children. As it is a known fact
that social and creative learning happens only when a child is healthy and safe. So, it became our
immediate priority to create awareness among children, teachers and communities about health and
safety so that children can explore, learn and grow.</p>
